A-Level Mathematics and Further Mathematics Pure Notes

This guide was written between July 2019 and May 2020, and is a reasonably comprehensive overview of the pure components of the mathematics and further mathematics course taught by Westminster School at this time. The course followed was the Oxford Cambridge and RSA (OCR) specification. I have included approximate textbook references where possible at the start of each section where you will find a more detailed explanation, worked examples, and exercises, alongside answers.

The order in which this is arranged is arbitrary, and where possible, I have tried to group similar topics together. Within this document, there is no real distinction between what is covered by the single mathematics and further mathematics courses, so you may have to look a little harder to find what you are looking for in here, compared to a textbook.
